======================================

1. Login to your Raspberry Pi with SSH or directly on the console.
2. For these test to work, you need the AdaFruit GPIO Library for python installed.
3. Execute the following commands in order:
	~ $ mkdir test
	~ $ cd test
	~ $ wget https://titanastro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sko-hatp5-tests.zip
	~ $ unzip sko-hatp4b-tests.zip
	~ $ ls

This will get you all the files you need for testing. Feel free to edit or improve!
